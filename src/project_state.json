  "summary": "Build a concert-travel deal comparison app that compares total trip cost across tickets, VIP packages, lodging, and multiple transportation modes (plane/train/taxi, etc.), can flag and auto-save better-value upgrades than the user’s originally saved choices, with teen-friendly safety/social features and cohesive quirky vintage travel-ticket branding—now aligning app naming/branding with the chosen domain-friendly name \"EOATravelDeals\".",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Core value: optimize total trip cost (tickets + VIP + lodging) rather than ticket price alone.",
    "Bundle generation requires integrating event ticket sources, VIP package availability, and hotel search/pricing.",
    "Adding social + photo features introduces major privacy/safety/compliance needs (age gating, parental consent, biometrics/face recognition, moderation, and data retention controls).",
    "Brand direction: quirky vintage travel aesthetic (old passport/ticket motif) with an optional fun tagline for teen-friendly appeal.",
    "Scope intent: broaden supplier integrations beyond a single provider (multiple ticket + accommodation/travel sources + VIP packages), increasing aggregation/normalization needs.",
    "Visual theme update request: switch primary palette to army green + navy blue + black.",
    "Support configurable display names/labels for major app sections (e.g., Profile, Memory Finder, Groups) so the UI can be rebranded without changing underlying feature behavior.",
    "Logo asset needs revision: old passport look while also clearly showing a perfectly preserved/readable airplane ticket element and a visible concert ticket element.",
    "Ensure branding/logo components (including login page) use responsive sizing to fill their intended container (e.g., correct width/height/object-fit) rather than rendering too small.",
    "Change initial routing/landing behavior so the unauthenticated login/sign-in page is the default first screen."

  "known_issues": [
    "AI was unable to complete the build request; user asked to retry ('Try doing it again').",
    "Current logo does not clearly show a readable preserved airplane ticket and visible concert ticket within the old passport motif; user requested a fix.",
    "Login page logo is rendered too small; user wants it sized to fit/fill the logo box.",
    "Welcome/sign-in screen copy is not matching desired text; user wants it to read \"Welcome to EOA\" (currently includes garbled/extra characters like \"W\").",
    "Login/auth flow currently forces account creation and/or redirects users to Google/Instagram login instead of the intended sign-in experience.",
    "On the default onboarding/sign-up screen, the top \"Sign in\" button routes users to an email/third-party quick sign-in hub (TikTok/YouTube/Gmail/etc.) instead of the intended sign-in method.",
    "Auth/session handling issue: logging out of the external email/third-party quick sign-in provider logs the user out of TripTally unexpectedly (session not independent/persistent)."
