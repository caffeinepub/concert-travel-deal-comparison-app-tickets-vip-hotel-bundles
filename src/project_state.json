  "summary": "Build a concert-travel deal comparison app that compares total trip cost across many ticketing sources, VIP packages, and lodging/travel providers, with teen-friendly safety/social features and cohesive quirky vintage travel-ticket branding.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Core value: optimize total trip cost (tickets + VIP + lodging) rather than ticket price alone.",
    "Bundle generation requires integrating event ticket sources, VIP package availability, and hotel search/pricing.",
    "Adding social + photo features introduces major privacy/safety/compliance needs (age gating, parental consent, biometrics/face recognition, moderation, and data retention controls).",
    "Brand direction: quirky vintage travel aesthetic (old passport/ticket motif) with an optional fun tagline for teen-friendly appeal.",
    "Scope intent: broaden supplier integrations beyond a single provider (multiple ticket + accommodation/travel sources + VIP packages), increasing aggregation/normalization needs.",
    "Visual theme update request: switch primary palette to army green + navy blue + black.",
    "Support configurable display names/labels for major app sections (e.g., Profile, Memory Finder, Groups) so the UI can be rebranded without changing underlying feature behavior.",
    "Logo asset needs revision: old passport look while also clearly showing a perfectly preserved/readable airplane ticket element and a visible concert ticket element.",
    "Ensure branding/logo components (including login page) use responsive sizing to fill their intended container (e.g., correct width/height/object-fit) rather than rendering too small.",
    "Change initial routing/landing behavior so the unauthenticated login/sign-in page is the default first screen."
