# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the unauthenticated sign-in / welcome screen heading to display the exact text “Welcome to EOA”.

**Planned changes:**
- Locate the unauthenticated sign-in / welcome screen UI and replace the heading/welcome copy with the exact casing: “Welcome to EOA”.
- Ensure the rendered welcome text contains no extra or garbled characters (e.g., no leading/trailing “W”).
- Confirm the updated heading remains readable on common desktop and mobile widths without changing authentication behavior.

**User-visible outcome:** When signed out and prompted to sign in, users will see a clear, correctly-cased heading that reads “Welcome to EOA”.
