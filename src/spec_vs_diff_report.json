  "summary": "Diff adds PWA support (manifest, service worker, offline fallback, registration, UI offline banner) and a Capacitor-style Android wrapper project plus Android build documentation. One key gap is that the required icon image files themselves are not shown as added. Additionally, some Android build configuration appears to include optional Google Services scaffolding which was not requested.",

      "reason": "The manifest and service worker reference the required PNG files under /assets/generated, but the diff summary does not show these image files being added to the repository.",
