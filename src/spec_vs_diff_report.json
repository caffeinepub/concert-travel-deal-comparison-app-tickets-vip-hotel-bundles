  "summary": "Implemented a per-route background system via a centralized route→asset mapping and applied it in AppLayout with fixed full-screen background + consistent dark overlay; however, the diff summary does not show the required background image files being added under frontend/public/assets/generated.",

      "id": "REQ-60",
      "requirement": "Add the new landscape background images as static assets under frontend/public/assets/generated and wire the route-to-background mapping to those exact filenames.",
      "reason": "The mapping references the required filenames, but the diff summary does not include any added files under frontend/public/assets/generated, so existence of the required static assets cannot be confirmed from the provided changes.",

      "description": "Preloading all background images on initial mount using new Image() for each mapped background.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest/ACs require performance (no visible jank) but do not explicitly request eager preloading of all backgrounds; this is an additional implementation detail beyond stated requirements.",
